# Security

This library provides shared utilities for UnisonOS services and does not run as a standalone network service.

For overall security guidance and how these utilities are intended to be used, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security issue in unison-common, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub rather than filing a public issue.
